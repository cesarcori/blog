Everybody has a journey into the mind that wants to express in many ways. 
Sometimes as a working, exercising, embracing the art, or another activity.

In my case, (in a busy life) I try to find a short time to download those 
ideas or thoughts that turn around into my mind.

Sometimes I have some feelings in my mind or soul. In those cases, 
I take some time wrinting those thoughts, and in some situatios I express them
through poems. Now I want to share with everybody who could be interested. 

With the hope of arriving at that place that we would like to stay.
